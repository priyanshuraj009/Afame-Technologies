# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is aimed at building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The dataset contains simulated credit card transactions from 1000 customers, covering legitimate and fraud transactions from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020.

## Project Description

The project demonstrates how to build a predictive model for detecting fraudulent transactions using Python and libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`. The dataset consists of customer transaction data from 1000 customers and over 800 merchants.

We explore various machine learning algorithms including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Features

- Fraud detection using machine learning models.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.
